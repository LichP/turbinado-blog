title: "Mounting NFS with Vagrant when Firewall Says No"

I'm currently playing around with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
on an [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/) 9 box to provision some VMs (also running AlmaLinux 9), which I plan
to use as dev boxes for testing Ansible configuration management. One of the fun side quests is to provide an NFS
export on the host box which can be accessed in all the Vagrant provisioned VMs. Vagrant has good support for this,
allowing you to specify an NFS synced folder in your Vagrantfile:

<Code lang="ruby" title="Vagrantfile">
{`Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.synced_folder "/host/path", "/guest/mount/point",
    type: "nfs",
    nfs_version: "4.2",
    nfs_udp: false

  # etc
end`}
</Code>

It takes care of modifying `/etc/exports` on the host, which is great, but we still need to our initial
configuration of NFS on the host to get things working. Being as I am an NFS newbie (I've carefully avoided it
as much as possible over the past 25 years), and as AlmaLinux is a rebadged
[RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux), I opted to follow the
[RHEL NFS clues for configuring and NFSv4 server](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_using_network_file_services/deploying-an-nfs-server_configuring-and-using-network-file-services#configuring-an-nfsv4-only-server_deploying-an-nfs-server)
which worked pretty well, but fell short on what was needed on the firewall step:

```sh
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service nfs
firewall-cmd --reload
```

After running `vagrant reload` my VMs were getting stuck mounting the nfs share:

```
$ vagrant reload
...
==> vagrant: Preparing to edit /etc/exports. Administrator privileges will be required...
==> vagrant: Mounting NFS shared folders...
    vagrant: /host/path => /guest/mount/point
The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

mount -o vers=4.2 192.168.121.1:/host/path /guest/mount/point
Stdout from the command:



Stderr from the command:

mount.nfs: Connection refused
```

Sure enough, when attempting to manually mount an NFS export inside the guest, it failed after a suitably long
timeout. So I tried temporarily turning off the host firewall (i.e. `systemctl stop firewalld`), and hey presto
it all worked just fine. So what gives?

## libvirt and firewalld

The answer was due to my use of [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) as the VM provider for Vagrant. It turns out
that if [firewalld](https://firewalld.org/) is present,
[libvirt will put its bridge interfaces in a firewalld zone](https://libvirt.org/firewall.html#firewalld-and-the-virtual-network-driver)
named "libvirt", so the magic incantation to allow the VM guests to access nfs on the host is:

```sh
firewall-cmd --permanent  --zone libvirt --add-service nfs
firewall-cmd --reload
```

Then it is fixed forever.
