I've been intrigued for a while about the trend towards headless CMS in recent years, in particular for the potential of these
technologies to help build sites that can bring together different back-end data sources, allowing the CMS component to focus
on what it's good at: being a CMS. There are a few options out there for doing this kind of thing, and for me
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) looked to be the most interesting one. While I've dabbled in React in recent years
(e.g. [Election Stats](https://www.npmjs.com/package/election-stats-icu)), I've yet to play with any server-side React, so I
thought what better way to get started than by making a personal blog?

The goals for this project are:

* Make a simple statically generated blog using Next.js.
* Blog posts should be composed in Markdown and live in the same repository.
* Blog posts need to be able to do nice code syntax highlighting.

## Contentlayer and MDX

My initial investigations on how to do this stuff brought two technologies to my attention:

* [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/): A content SDK for transforming content to type-safe JSON from various sources.
* [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/): Combine Markdown with JSX.

There's a bunch of blogs and YouTube vids about using Contentlayer with MDX to do exactly this kind of thing, but digging a
little deeper I became concerned about the
[support situation for Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/429), so decided to steer clear.

## Using MDX directly

With Contentlayer out of the picture, I then started investigating using MDX directly, and quickly discovered an excellent
blog post on [Building a blog with Next.js 14 and React Server Components](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13)
by [Max Leiter](https://maxleiter.com/), which ticked all the boxes.

If you've come here looking for a tutorial on how to do this stuff, then your next step is to go read Max's blog post, which
will get you up and running. For the rest of this blog post I'll focus on the bits I learned along the way, and on the things
I opted to do a little differently.

## Front matter

Having not built a staticly generated site before I hadn't really encountered the idea of front matter, where a content file
is prefixed with a piece of YAML (or TOML etc) to provide structured metadata. Max uses
[grey-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) for this, which allows us to provide the blog title, description,
slug, and post date directly in the mdx file.

## Where did all my pages go?

After getting to the state where Things Should Work I fired up `npm run dev`, went to my browser and tried to access a blog
post. Next JS threw back a 404 in my face for the blog post, but also for the site home page which had previously worked.
I was a bit stumped, until I spotted that I'd missed out typescript extensions when setting up MDX in `next.config.js`:

```next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    // Without 'ts' and 'tsx', our typescript components will simply be ignored and everything becomes Not Found
    //pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx'],
    pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mdx'],
}

const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')();

module.exports = withMDX(nextConfig);
```
