I've been working on updating a .NET Framework WCF service to ASP.Net Core using CoreWCF, and everything was going nicely
until I decided to swap out my database connection string from `appsettings.json` to dotnet user secrets. I've used user
secrets on a couple of other projects, so was already familiar with doing the setup, which all worked as expected: the
`UserSecretsId` attribute was added to the csproj project file, and I set my connection string secret on the commandline
exactly as I'd done in previous projects. According to the
[app secrets documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=windows),
user secrets would be enabled automatically for the Development environment without me having to do anything extra, so it
should all Just Work. So I launch the debug build in Visual Studio, but instead of everything Just Working I get a nasty
exception as soon as something tries to touch the database, and it's quite clear from the logs that the connection string
has not been picked up from user secrets. The entire rest of my afternoon was then consumed trying to debug why.

The docs say user secrets are only enabled in the Development environment, so I double check this and confirm that after
creating my builder with `var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);` the builder's environment is indeed
`Development`, having set a breakpoint so I can inspect it in the Visual Studio Locals window. I also observed that the
expected configuration values were missing in `builder.Configuration`, so it seemed that either `AddUserSecrets` was not
being called, or it was being called but wasn't working. The internet was not forthcoming with clues, so the next step was
to try calling `AddUserSecrets` directly after creating the builder, and after a bit more interneting I figured out how to
do that:

```Program.cs 
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Configuration.AddUserSecrets("uuid string");
```
 
Launch the app, and hey presto: secrets have been found, the builder configuration knows the connection string, and the
app behaves as expected. So why wasn't it working via `CreateBuilder`, or `CreateSlimBuilder`? After more deep diving
poking into the ASP.NET Core source, I eventually figured out that the builders called `AddUserSecrets` using a different
method signature, passing in the `Assembly` from which to extract the UUID. So I tried doing that directly:

```Program.cs 
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var appAssembly = Assembly.Load(new AssemblyName(builder.Environment.ApplicationName));
builder.Configuration.AddUserSecrets(appAssembly);
```
 
Launch the app, secrets not found. Poking around at appAssembly in the Locals there clearly wasn't anything there for the
`UserSecretsIdAttribute`. Why? It was then that I discovered
[this stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64116657/could-not-find-usersecretsidattribute-on-assembly-but-it-exists-and-correct-pa/64851966)
with the top answer being to check for `<GenerateAssemblyInfo>true</GenerateAssemblyInfo>` in the project file, so I take
a look and aha! `GenerateAssemblyInfo` was false, so the `UserSecretsId` attribute was not being included in the assembly,
causing `AddUserSecrets` to fail. Flip `GenerateAssemblyInfo` to true, relaunch, and hey presto, fixed forever. I don't
know why `GenerateAssemblyInfo` was false before, maybe it made sense to the way the original .NET Framework WCF
implementation was being deployed, but whatever the reason it led to a classic case of an afternoon of debugging for a
simple one-line fix.
